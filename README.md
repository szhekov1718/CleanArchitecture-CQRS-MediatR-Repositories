# Leave Management System in C# - using Clean Architecture, CQRS, Repositories and MediatR

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a powerful approach to build solid and robust software. Unit Testing is a type of software testing where code is written to automate the testing of sub-sections of an entire application. This methodology gives more functional coverage and reduces the need for manual regression testing when the application's code changes. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. 

## Tools used in the LeaveManagementSystem: 

- Used a **Clean (Onion/Layered) Architecture** as well as the Best Coding Practices
- Implemented the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation** (CQRS) pattern
- Implemented the **MediatR** Pattern
- Implemented an Email Service using **SendGrid**
- Efficient Exception Handling and Routing
- Wrote Unit Tests with **Moq** and **Shouldy**
- Global Error Handling with **Custom Middleware** and Exceptions
- Added Validation Using **Fluent Validation**
- Implemented JWT **(JSON Web Token)** Authentication
